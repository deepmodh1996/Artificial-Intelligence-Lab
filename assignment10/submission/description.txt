Q.1
We do sampling based on legal positions uniformly.
Here sampling replaces the use of probabilities.
GetBelief is converting sampling into probability based on cardinality.


Q.2
For each particle, we get the distribution of new set of positions and we do sample based on that. (for each particle)

Q.3
Using iteratortool.product, we get tuple of possible position for ghosts.
for each ghost based on emmision model and true distance of particle, we get probability which is multiplied for a tuple.(fundamental law of multiplication for probability)
for elapse time based on getPositionDistributionForGhost, we get position probability distribution and then get a sample for that ghost
